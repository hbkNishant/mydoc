**Subject: Clarification Required Regarding Ticket US124389 Review**

Hi Fang,

I hope you're doing well. 

While reviewing the ticket **US124389**, I encountered a couple of issues specifically related to **AC3**:
1. I am not getting the "data backup is required" error.
2. While running the job on Obsidian, I did not see the red cross button to interrupt or stop the job as mentioned.

Additionally, the ticket references the class **ObsidianMedicalReviewPurgeJob**, which I found in your branch. However, in the master branch, I only see **ObsidianPurgeJob**. Could you please clarify if I'm on the right path with this or if thereâ€™s a discrepancy between the branches?

I also attempted to build your branch but ran into errors during the build process. Could you provide some guidance on which branch I should be working on? If necessary, I would appreciate it if we could have a discussion to go over the details and resolve this efficiently.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Nishant
