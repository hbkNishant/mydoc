Many people who are in treatment relapse more than once before they completely quit drinking or using drugs. If this happens to you, don`t feel like you are a failure. Instead, keep working toward your goal. Make a plan to prevent another relapse.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Early warning signs of relapse may include: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Out of control cravings that make you want to drink or take drugs &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spending more time in places with people who drink or take drugs &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Feelings of overconfidence or impatience with your treatment plan &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Thinking &quot;I can control my drug use if I only do it with my friends&quot; or &quot;This treatment isn`t working.

Do not change or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider first &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Avoid your personal &quot;triggers&quot;&lt;/B&gt; by not going places where alcohol or drugs are available. Find new friends that don`t drink or use. Develop new healthy activities or hobbies. Talk to your counselor about new ways to cope with the stress of recovering &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Remind yourself of your reasons for quitting&lt;/B&gt;. It might be helpful to write them down and carry them with you to help in difficult situations &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Know your &quot;no&quot;.&lt;/B&gt; You are certain to be in a situation at some point where alcohol or drugs are available. Be ready with your &quot;No thanks&quot;. The faster you can say &quot;no&quot; to these offers, the less likely you are to give in to them &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Get support from others&lt;/B&gt;.

Others may be there to help, but at the end of the day the choice to change is yours.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;There are many treatment choices for addiction. You and your provider should talk about the choices and find the path that will be best for you.

Ask yourself what worked and what didn&apos;t. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can ask your healthcare provider for help. They can help you find a counselor and may recommend medicine to help you quit. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Your mind is very powerful. It helps to tell you, &quot;I can quit,&quot; and &quot;I can take control of my health.&quot; In your mind, start to picture yourself as a person who doesn&apos;t use drugs or alcohol. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Some people find that support groups have helped them to quit successfully (i.e. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous(NA)).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

Some young people feel that using alcohol or drugs makes them appear more mature or helps them fit in with their friends. If the people you hang out with use drugs and alcohol, it may seem like everyone is doing it, so it must not be a big deal. Sometimes young people use drugs and alcohol to help them cope with something bad that happened to them in the past or because their parents use drugs or alcohol.&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Would you like to hear more about substance use among young people?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given&lt;/I&gt;: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The harm that comes from alcohol and drug use is much greater than any good feelings it gives you &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use of alcohol and drugs has been associated with an increase in car accidents, criminal acts, difficulty in school (e.g., poor performance, being expelled), engaging in risky behavior like unprotected sex, physical dating violence, and an increased risk of dying from suicide, homicide, or an accident &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Even if you think you can quit anytime, you might not always be able to quit. Almost everyone who continues to use alcohol/drugs can become addicted. The earlier you stop using alcohol/drugs, the easier it will be to have the willpower to quit &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;TV, internet, social media and radio ads market their products (wine, beer, hard liquor) to make them appealing to young people. Friends you know may tell you that &quot;getting high&quot; is cool. They want to influence your decision about drinking or using, but you can be an independent thinker. You can make a different and better choice for yourself &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You may have friends who take prescription medicines that are not theirs. They may think this is safe because the medicines were prescribed by a healthcare provider. They may even offer these medicines to you. This type of drug use is not any safer than using &quot;street&quot; drugs. Many of these medicines can be addictive and have side-effects that can cause serious health problems and even death &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;More American teens do not use alcohol/drugsthan those who do. Most do not think it is cool &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It helps to spend time with people who can encourage you to quit using alcohol or drugs. You don`t need to do it alone. Find someone you trust and ask them for help quitting &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real friends shouldn`t reject you for saying &quot;no&quot;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

If you &quot;need&quot; a drink or a fix and don&apos;t have one, you will start to have withdrawal symptoms. Using alcohol and drugscan make you feel less stressed because it decreases the withdrawal symptoms for a while. But these feelings will return unless you have another drink or a fix. You may think it will help you relax, but they actually increase anxiety as a result of withdrawal symptoms, legal trouble, or problems at school, work and in relationships&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Instead of using alcohol or drugs, find other ways to relax. Healthy ways to relax include deep breathing, meditating, exercise (e.g. short walk, stretching), prayer, listening to music, doing a hobby, or closing your eyes and thinking about a pleasant scene. You can also find fun things to do with people who don`t drink or use drug&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

										<EducationComponent UUID="00000f55-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="The Problem of Alcohol/Substance Use">Sometimes, people start drinking too much, take medicines that are prescribed to other people, or turn to street/illegal drugs to manage stress or cope with a chronic condition. Often, people combine alcohol and drugs, or take more than one type of harmful drug. These substances are dangerous and can seriously harm your brain and body, as well as relationships, education and employment. They can: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Worsen depression or other health conditions &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Damage your organs, including your heart, liver, kidneys, and brain &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cause you to hurt yourself. For example, they may cause a fall or accident &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make you need the substance (physical dependence). This causes uncomfortable symptoms and could lead you to overdose to make the discomfort go away &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lead to having a substance use disorder. This happens when all you can think about is getting and using that substance. This can cause you to ruin your relationships with other people and make it even harder to cope &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lead to life-threatening situations, including suicide, violence, motor vehicle accidents, accidental overdose, or death &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; If you see yourself using substances to numb emotions or to cope with a chronic condition, it&apos;s important that you get help. Talk to your provider or a counselor or join a support group.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;For teens and children&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can say no to alcohol and drugs. You have the right to make good choices for yourself and say what you do or don&apos;t want to do &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can say something like, &quot;No, I&apos;ve decided not to do that&quot; &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;If diabetes&lt;/B&gt;: You can say &quot;No thanks, that stuff messes with my diabetes&quot; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can feel good about making the best decisions for yourself &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;For adult with diabetes&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Using alcohol or drugs can cause a lot of problems if you have diabetes. Some things you should know about alcohol, drugs, and diabetes: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Alcohol can make your blood sugar go too low &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You may not notice the low sugar feeling because of the alcohol &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Continuing to drink when your sugar is low can cause you to pass out and then your sugar could go even lower &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Friends who do not know you have diabetes may think you are just acting different because of the alcohol and may not know that you are in danger &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On the other hand, wine coolers, beer, and alcohol mixed into sweet fruity drinks will raise your blood sugar &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you don`t count carbs and check your sugar, you could end up with a very high blood sugar &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The dangers of drugs for people with diabetes are like the dangers of alcohol. Using drugs can: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Raise or lower your blood sugar &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Affect your appetite so you either neglect to eat, or eat way too much &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cause you to lose interest in taking care of your diabetes &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cause you to not take your medicines&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

										<EducationComponent UUID="00000fa5-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="How to Ask for Help">Everyone needs help from time to time. You are probably the best judge of whether or not you need help with your daily activities. Sometimes we also need a little help from others to support us emotionally. I realize that it can be hard to ask for help. You may feel that you are losing control over your life or you may feel embarrassed or weak.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts on ways to ask for help?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Praise member for appropriate responses&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: May I give you some tips that others have found helpful?&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given, provide as much detail as needed to support member.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It helps to:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start by making a list of things that you could use some help with. For example: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Light housekeeping (e.g., cleaning, laundry)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Meals&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Medicines (e.g., filling prescriptions, setting up pill box)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Getting supplies (e.g., clothing, toiletries, cleaning supplies, medical equipment)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Transportation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Money (e.g., paying bills, getting financial help)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Household maintenance (e.g., making repairs to house, taking care of the yard)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Personal care (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Nursing services (e.g., changing a bandage)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Emotional support&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Finding information&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Next, think of the people you know who can help you (e.g., family members, friends, church members). Think of how they can help you and give them a call. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you don&apos;t feel comfortable calling them, have another family member or friend do it for you.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remember that even people who live far away can help you. For example, you could have the household bills forwarded to them or they can find out information for you. You can ask someone to find out about community resources in your area.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;For older adults&lt;/B&gt;: Call the local Area Agency on Aging for information on resources in your area. (To find your local Area Agency on Aging, call the national Eldercare Locator at 800-677-1116).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Do you feel that you can ask for help if needed?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If not very confident, explore and problem-solve&lt;/I&gt;</EducationComponent>
										<EducationComponent UUID="000010a4-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="How to Manage Anger and Conflict">&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If member is working on this skill with a therapist, defer to what the therapist has advised them to do&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Anger is a normal emotion. We all feel angry sometimes. The problem with anger is that sometimes we let anger take control of our emotions. When this happens people become hard to live with or deal with and conflicts with others occur.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;If behavioral health or chronic pain condition&lt;/B&gt;: In addition, anger that isn&apos;t dealt with in a healthy way can make it harder to manage your &amp;lt;&lt;I&gt;condition&lt;/I&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts on ways to manage your anger and work out conflicts?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Praise member for appropriate responses&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: May I give you some tips that others have found helpful?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given:&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You can:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Walk away from the angry situation. Take time to cool down.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ask yourself what else you are feeling. Disappointed? Sad? Scared? Embarrassed? Anger can be so strong that it covers up other feelings. Just noticing your other emotions can help the anger fade.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Express your anger in a specific and positive way, &quot;I feel angry when...&quot; &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Don&apos;t shout or curse&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Practice saying what you need in a calm and respectful way. For example: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&quot;That is not okay with me&quot;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not going to decide now. I need to think about it.&quot;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When there is a conflict, ask the other person to talk it out when you have both had time to calm down. Ask them what ideas they have for solving the problem.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use humor. Sometimes thinking of something silly when you are angry is just enough to break the anger and help you to think more calmly about the problem.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use coping skills such as relaxation or positive self-talk.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Do you feel that you can use some of these tips the next time you get angry or have a conflict with someone?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If not very confident, explore and problem-solve&lt;/I&gt;</EducationComponent>

The key is to find a good way to solve the problems we have.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are some things that you do to take care of problems?&quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Congratulate member on self-management activities that they are doing.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: May I give you some tips that may help you solve problems?&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given, provide as much detail as needed to support member:&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Check your attitude&lt;/B&gt;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Many times we can talk ourselves out of being negative to being positive&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Talk about things the way you would want them to be&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Realize that you don&apos;t have to solve your problem alone.

It is one thing to say &quot;I hate my life&quot;, but that is too broad to try to solve. You will be more successful if you break things into smaller pieces. For example, &quot;My family and I argue a lot&quot; or &quot;I don&apos;t have enough money to pay the bills&quot;. If there are several problems, start with the one that is bothering you the most.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Define the goal&lt;/B&gt;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What do you want to achieve or change? Work hard to become clear on what results you want. Your goal should be: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Specific (certain, very clear to you) so that you will know when you have done it (not &quot;I want to feel better&quot;, but &quot;I want to manage my pain so that I am able to do more.&quot;)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Something you know you can do (realistic, practical, and achievable)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Clear, so that you know what to do and when to do it&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Come up with ideas&lt;/B&gt;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Try to think of all possible ways to achieve your goal. Be creative. Even if it seems like a crazy option, make a list of all possible solutions. Talk to people you trust, talk to your provider, go on-line or read books related to your problem. This step is to give you as many choices and ideas as possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It may help to write down the pros and cons for each idea. Think about them and be reasonable (practical, logical) but also consider your &quot;gut feeling&quot; about the choices. Think: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What is the best thing that might happen?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What are the benefits?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Could this cause more problems?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is it something I really want to do?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What might get in the way of my idea (or plan)? How can I avoid or deal with that roadblock?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How confident am I that this could work?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Decide what to do&lt;/B&gt;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;After you have gone through all of your ideas, it is time to pick the one that you think will work best. The next thing is to plan exactly how to do it.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ask: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What steps should I take? Plan steps that you will be able to do day by day or week by week.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What role can others play in supporting me?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What is my start date? What needs to happen after that?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Carry out your plan&lt;/B&gt;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do it!

										<EducationComponent UUID="000010a3-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="How to Recognize Distorted Thinking">&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If member is working on this skill with a therapist, defer to what the therapist has advised them to do&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Many times we react to situations automatically. We tend to repeat ways of thinking out of habit. These thoughts become so automatic that we often don`t question them. Our thoughts can be skewed or distorted, but we believe them anyway. Believing distorted thoughts often leads to negative feelings, such as guilt, worry, anger, and despair. Distorted thinking gets in the way of solving problems.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;The first step in stopping distorted thinking is to know when it is happening.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Would you like to hear some examples of distorted thinking?&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given, provide as much detail as needed to support member:&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Distorted thinking includes:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All or nothing thinking - Seeing things as either all bad or all good; or right or wrong &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When you make a mistake, thinking you have failed. Or when your friend lets you down, thinking she is a bad person&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mind reading - Assuming you know what someone is thinking without checking it out. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When you call someone and they don&apos;t answer the phone, thinking that they don&apos;t want to talk to you.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fortune telling - Thinking you know what is going to happen, when you have no way of predicting the future. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When planning to ask for help, saying, &quot;No one will help me.&quot;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Magnification - Exaggerated thinking or making things more important than they are. Also known as making a mountain out of molehill. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When something doesn&apos;t go as planned, thinking your whole day is ruined.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Emotional reasoning - Accepting a feeling as fact. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When you feel upset about a situation, believing that because you feel that way the situation is terrible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;If bipolar disorder:&lt;/B&gt; For example: When you have manic symptoms and feel that you can do anything, making a bold decision without considering the possible risks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overgeneralizing - Thinking that because something happened once, it will always happen. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When you are disappointed, thinking things will never go your way.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mislabeling - Also known as name-calling. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When you don&apos;t get a job you applied for, thinking you are a loser. Or when another driver pulls out in front of you, thinking that person is an idiot.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Taking things personally - Assuming that someone&apos;s actions are directed toward you when they may not be. &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example: When someone leaves the room while you are talking, thinking they are upset with you.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Do you recognize any of these?&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;When you feel sad, angry, depressed, or anxious, it helps to pay attention to your thoughts. If you are having distorted thoughts like the examples we talked about, those thoughts may be driving your negative feelings. It helps to stop and examine your thoughts. Question them before you accept them as fact. Ask yourself:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Does my thinking really make sense?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do my thoughts help me solve the problem?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is there another way to think about this?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Optional&lt;/I&gt;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that helps people learn how to change distorted thinking. CBT is an effective treatment for many mental health problems, including depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Do you feel that you can begin to recognize distorted thinking?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If not very confident, explore and problem-solve&lt;/I&gt;</EducationComponent>

										<EducationComponent UUID="00001154-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="How to Quit Using Alcohol/Drugs">There are different treatment options to help you successfully quit using drugs/alcohol. Sometimes combining approaches will be more helpful than using one alone. They include:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Medicine to help you stop using alcohol/drugs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A counseling program (e.g., brief intervention, support groups, cognitive behavioral therapies, technology-based interventions) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Peer support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are other thoughts on ways to quit using drugs/alcohol?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Praise member for appropriate responses&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: May I give you information about stopping use of drugs/alcohol?&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given, provide as much detail as needed to support member&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Withdrawal symptoms can include:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Feeling irritable, nervous, frustrated or depressed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Having trouble thinking clearly&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Having trouble sleeping&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Feeling hungry, even after eating &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;Use your medicines as directed to help with feelings of withdrawal. Withdrawal is your body letting you know that it&apos;s adjusting to being free of alcohol or drugs. As time passes, quitting your substance use will get easier. You will start feeling better and enjoying non-drug activities and rewards&lt;BR /&gt;Managing cravings: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Wait for the craving for alcohol/drugs to pass&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Relax by taking slow deep breaths and picturing a pleasant scene&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Stay away from things, places and people that tempt you to use alcohol/drugs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do things and go places where you are not able to use alcohol/drugs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Change daily activities that you associate with using alcohol/drugs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Substitute use of alcohol/drugs with healthier options. If you always drink or use when you wake up in the morning, peel and eat a piece of fruit instead. If you drink or use after a meal, go for a walk instead&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reward yourself for quitting. Do a pleasant or fun activity or hobby&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keep a list of the benefits of being drug/alcohol-free and read it often&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remember your goal is to never drink alcohol or use drugs again&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Which of these tips do you think would work for you?</EducationComponent>
										<EducationComponent UUID="00001022-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="The Problem of Alcohol Use and Hepatitis or Cirrhosis">Alcohol use and hepatitis or cirrhosis is a bad mix.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Your liver breaks down alcohol so it can be removed from your body. This releases chemicals. Some of these can inflame your liver. Over time, heavy drinking can lead to and worsen liver damage or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;When you have a liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, your liver is already having a hard time doing its job. Drinking alcohol stresses it more.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;If hepatitis C&lt;/B&gt;: Alcohol speeds up liver damage in people with hepatitis C. &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;As a result of using alcohol: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;There may be more virus in your blood&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Medicine used to fight the virus may not work as well&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Your risk of getting cirrhosis or liver cancer increases&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Men who drink more than 14 drinks a week, and women who drink more than seven drinks a week are at greater risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Avoiding alcohol can help your body fight the hepatitis virus. It can help prevent serious liver damage. &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Not using alcohol at all is best. If that is difficult for you, you can ask your healthcare provider for help and support.&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If member is interested, check benefits for behavioral health coverage for alcohol abuse treatment&lt;/I&gt;.</EducationComponent>
										<EducationComponent UUID="00000f55-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="The Problem of Alcohol/Substance Use">Sometimes, people start drinking too much, take medicines that are prescribed to other people, or turn to street/illegal drugs to manage stress or cope with a chronic condition. Often, people combine alcohol and drugs, or take more than one type of harmful drug. These substances are dangerous and can seriously harm your brain and body, as well as relationships, education and employment. They can: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Worsen depression or other health conditions &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Damage your organs, including your heart, liver, kidneys, and brain &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cause you to hurt yourself. For example, they may cause a fall or accident &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make you need the substance (physical dependence). This causes uncomfortable symptoms and could lead you to overdose to make the discomfort go away &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lead to having a substance use disorder. This happens when all you can think about is getting and using that substance. This can cause you to ruin your relationships with other people and make it even harder to cope &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lead to life-threatening situations, including suicide, violence, motor vehicle accidents, accidental overdose, or death &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; If you see yourself using substances to numb emotions or to cope with a chronic condition, it&apos;s important that you get help. Talk to your provider or a counselor or join a support group.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;For teens and children&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can say no to alcohol and drugs. You have the right to make good choices for yourself and say what you do or don&apos;t want to do &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can say something like, &quot;No, I&apos;ve decided not to do that&quot; &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;If diabetes&lt;/B&gt;: You can say &quot;No thanks, that stuff messes with my diabetes&quot; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can feel good about making the best decisions for yourself &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;For adult with diabetes&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Using alcohol or drugs can cause a lot of problems if you have diabetes. Some things you should know about alcohol, drugs, and diabetes: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Alcohol can make your blood sugar go too low &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You may not notice the low sugar feeling because of the alcohol &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Continuing to drink when your sugar is low can cause you to pass out and then your sugar could go even lower &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Friends who do not know you have diabetes may think you are just acting different because of the alcohol and may not know that you are in danger &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On the other hand, wine coolers, beer, and alcohol mixed into sweet fruity drinks will raise your blood sugar &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you don`t count carbs and check your sugar, you could end up with a very high blood sugar &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The dangers of drugs for people with diabetes are like the dangers of alcohol. Using drugs can: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Raise or lower your blood sugar &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Affect your appetite so you either neglect to eat, or eat way too much &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cause you to lose interest in taking care of your diabetes &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cause you to not take your medicines&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>
										<EducationComponent UUID="000011af-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="The Problem of Substance Use and Pregnancy">With any pregnancy, harmful substances such as alcohol and drugs can negatively impact your the health of you and your baby. Alcohol and drugs can cross the placenta and reach your baby. Alcohol and drugs also negatively affect your unborn baby&apos;s ability to get nutrition from the food you eat. Heavy drinkers are more likely to substitute alcohol for healthy food choices and further limit nutrition to an unborn baby.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Alcohol use after the first trimester increases the risk for your child to have Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Excessive alcohol intake can result in fetal alcohol syndrome. A baby born with fetal alcohol syndrome may not grow properly and have mental or physical disabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;Drugs also have a negative impact on your baby. This includes illegal drugs, over the counter (OTC) drugs, and prescription drugs not prescribed for you. Some that can cause specific harm to your baby include: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Marijuana - a plant product that, when smoked, exposes the baby to the marijuana smoke that is inhaled by the mother. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cocaine - highly addictive, it can cause preterm birth. Babies born to women who use cocaine may grow more slowly and may be more irritable or fussy than babies not exposed to cocaine before birth. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Heroin - when used during pregnancy can cause preterm birth or even fetal death. Children of women who use heroin during pregnancy may be smaller, have trouble thinking clearly, and have behavioral problems. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot; or &quot;crystal meth&quot;) - raises a woman&apos;s blood pressure and heart rate and puts her and her baby at a risk of stroke, brain damage, premature birth, and miscarriage. Babies exposed to methamphetamine also may grow too slowly in the womb, have trouble bonding with others, and be very fussy.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;If you are having difficulty with alcohol or drug use, talk with your healthcare provider about getting a referral to a counselor and/or rehab program to address these issues. Your health and the health of your baby will need to be monitored closely before and after you deliver.&lt;BR /&gt;Q. Would you be willing to discuss these issues with your provider?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Yes:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Assist member in planning next steps&lt;/I&gt;</EducationComponent>
										<EducationComponent UUID="C699E042-63CA-7754-AC91-2EE57AABA5A5" Title="Understanding Cannabis Edibles">Q: Tell me what you know about cannabis edibles. &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: Listen and praise the member for what they know&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Cannabis edibles can include candy, brownies, chocolate, butter, baked goods, beverages and drinks such as energy drinks. &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Would you like to learn more?&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission is given&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Cannabis edibles contain THC. You can become addicted to THC&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;The amount of THC in an edible and the speed that your body breaks it down varies, so the effect it may have on you is unpredictable. The &quot;high&quot; often occurs in about 30 minutes after eating the product but can take longer.&lt;BR /&gt;Because of this delay, people think there is no effect, so eat more than planned. This results in eating too much and can cause sudden erratic behavior including:&lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Increased anxiety &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Being violent&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Increased risk of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and heart attacks in teens and adults&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Seeing and hearing things that are not there&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Loss of control over your behavior&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Catatonic (trance-like) state where you cannot move or speak&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Cannabis can affect thinking, decision-making and coordination for about 6 hours, and can cause risky and dangerous behavior. It can make underlying mental health conditions, including schizophrenia and depression, worse. Long-term health effects of edibles are not known at this time.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Packaging and products are often colorful and candy-like making edibles attractive to children. Serious illness and death can occur when children eat cannabis products.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Recreational cannabis is legal in some states and at a certain age. Know the laws in your state and understand the risks of trying cannabis edibles.

Ask yourself what worked and what didn&apos;t. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can ask your healthcare provider for help. They can help you find a counselor and may recommend medicine to help you quit. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Your mind is very powerful. It helps to tell you, &quot;I can quit,&quot; and &quot;I can take control of my health.&quot; In your mind, start to picture yourself as a person who doesn&apos;t use drugs or alcohol. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Some people find that support groups have helped them to quit successfully (i.e. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous(NA)).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

Some young people feel that using alcohol or drugs makes them appear more mature or helps them fit in with their friends. If the people you hang out with use drugs and alcohol, it may seem like everyone is doing it, so it must not be a big deal. Sometimes young people use drugs and alcohol to help them cope with something bad that happened to them in the past or because their parents use drugs or alcohol.&lt;BR /&gt;Q: Would you like to hear more about substance use among young people?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;NOTE: If permission given&lt;/I&gt;: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The harm that comes from alcohol and drug use is much greater than any good feelings it gives you &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use of alcohol and drugs has been associated with an increase in car accidents, criminal acts, difficulty in school (e.g., poor performance, being expelled), engaging in risky behavior like unprotected sex, physical dating violence, and an increased risk of dying from suicide, homicide, or an accident &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Even if you think you can quit anytime, you might not always be able to quit. Almost everyone who continues to use alcohol/drugs can become addicted. The earlier you stop using alcohol/drugs, the easier it will be to have the willpower to quit &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;TV, internet, social media and radio ads market their products (wine, beer, hard liquor) to make them appealing to young people. Friends you know may tell you that &quot;getting high&quot; is cool. They want to influence your decision about drinking or using, but you can be an independent thinker. You can make a different and better choice for yourself &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You may have friends who take prescription medicines that are not theirs. They may think this is safe because the medicines were prescribed by a healthcare provider. They may even offer these medicines to you. This type of drug use is not any safer than using &quot;street&quot; drugs. Many of these medicines can be addictive and have side-effects that can cause serious health problems and even death &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;More American teens do not use alcohol/drugsthan those who do. Most do not think it is cool &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It helps to spend time with people who can encourage you to quit using alcohol or drugs. You don`t need to do it alone. Find someone you trust and ask them for help quitting &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real friends shouldn`t reject you for saying &quot;no&quot;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

These changes may temporarily make you feel less stressed, relaxed and even happy&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Alcohol and drugs are addictive. If you &quot;need&quot; a drink or a fix and don&apos;t have one, you will start to have withdrawal symptoms. Using alcohol and drugscan make you feel less stressed because it decreases the withdrawal symptoms for a while. But these feelings will return unless you have another drink or a fix. You may think it will help you relax, but they actually increase anxiety as a result of withdrawal symptoms, legal trouble, or problems at school, work and in relationships&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Instead of using alcohol or drugs, find other ways to relax. Healthy ways to relax include deep breathing, meditating, exercise (e.g. short walk, stretching), prayer, listening to music, doing a hobby, or closing your eyes and thinking about a pleasant scene. You can also find fun things to do with people who don`t drink or use drug&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What are your thoughts about this?</EducationComponent>

										<EducationComponent UUID="00000e44-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="Understanding Blood Pressure">Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels called arteries. The pressure (force) goes up when the heart beats; that is the top number of a blood pressure reading (systolic). The pressure falls when the heart rests between beats; this is the bottom number of a blood pressure reading (diastolic).&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;There is no way to feel what your blood pressure is. Your blood pressure can be high (hypertension) and you may not know it. The only way to know if your blood pressure is high is to have it checked. It is important to monitor your blood pressure. &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Have your blood pressure checked on the schedule your healthcare provider recommends: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;For CAD, diabetes, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease&lt;/B&gt;: Because you have &amp;lt;&lt;I&gt;member&apos;s condition&lt;/I&gt;&amp;gt; it is important to have your blood pressure checked at every healthcare provider visit and at least twice a year by a healthcare provider &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;For all others&lt;/B&gt;: It is important to have your blood pressure checked at every healthcare provider visit and at least once a year &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;You may want to learn how to check your blood pressure at home as well: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Follow your healthcare provider&apos;s instructions about how often to check your blood pressure &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ask your healthcare provider to watch you check your blood pressure to make sure you are doing it correctly &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;Each time you check your own blood pressure, record the numbers and the date: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Take your blood pressure record with you to healthcare provider visits &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Take your home blood pressure machine to healthcare provider visits to check the accuracy of your home machine &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;Blood pressure changes can occur as a result of your activities, feelings, and what you eat or drink: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It increases with activity or if you feel nervous or have other strong emotions &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It decreases when you are resting, asleep or feel calm and relaxed &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It temporarily increases when you eat, smoke, have caffeine, or drink alcohol so wait for 30 minutes or longer before routinely checking your blood pressure &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;B&gt;If current BP available&lt;/B&gt;: Your blood pressure has been about &amp;lt;&lt;I&gt;member&apos;s BP from lab table&lt;/I&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;If target BP from provider available&lt;/B&gt;: Your healthcare provider would like you to have a blood pressure of &amp;lt;&lt;I&gt;member&apos;s BP target from provider&lt;/I&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;If target BP from provider not available&lt;/B&gt;: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The goal for most adults is to keep blood pressure below 130/80.

The ranges are based on age, gender, and height. Your provider can tell you what a good blood pressure goal is for you &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; If your blood pressure is higher than the goal most of the time, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle changes to help you decrease your blood pressure. Eat a healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and other heart healthy foods, and lower in salt/sodium), limit alcohol, add more daily physical activity, lose weight if you need to, quit smoking, and learn healthy ways to cope with stress. Some people may also need to take one or more medicines to help lower their blood pressure.&lt;BR /&gt;Q: What questions do you have about this?</EducationComponent>

										<EducationComponent UUID="00000f5a-2935-46bd-9705-bf686ed401bd" Title="Discuss with Provider: Blood Pressure">It`s important to ask your healthcare provider about the best values for your blood pressure, and how often to have blood pressure checked. Measuring your blood pressure at home between your healthcare provider visits may be necessary and helpful.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Knowing your blood pressure is important, even if you`re feeling fine. Some healthcare providers consider blood pressure to be: &lt;UL class=&quot;tightSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt; Normal&lt;/B&gt; (less than 120/80) - you can work with your healthcare provider to keep it that way &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt; Elevated &lt;/B&gt;(120/80 or higher, but less than 130/80) - your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle changes &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt; High or hypertension&lt;/B&gt; (130/80 or higher) - you and your healthcare provider need to agree on your blood pressure goal, and develop a plan and timetable to reach your goal &lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;If diabetes: &lt;/B&gt;If you have diabetes, your blood pressure goal may be different&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;If under age 18&lt;/B&gt;: Normal blood pressure numbers are different for teens and children than for adults. The numbers are based on age, gender, and height&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Monitoring your blood pressure helps find problems early. It can also show how well your treatment plan is working.
